What is it?
-----------

cachedriver is a hypervisor-controlled memory and disk cache system that 
exposes the spare memory to applications so that it utilizes 
all the memory left in the system for the future uses. 
Also, disk supports the small memory to have more space to put application data. 

For more information see https://github.com/jinho10/mortar-cachedriver

Compile
-------
xen-4.1.2

Supplementary Code
------------------

-. linux kernel
In order to access hypervisor-controlled memory, we need modified linux kernel
stored in https://github.com/jinho10/old-mortar.

-. modified memcached
applications can use memcached protocol using cmemcached
stored in https://github.com/jinho10/old-mortar.

Grub Setting
--------------
Add this:
multiboot /boot/xen.gz mcd

Running
-------
basic running refers to https://github.com/jinho10/mortar.

external cache driver
xen-4.1.2/tools/mcd/mcd <directory>

Commands
--------
sudo xl <commands>

<commands>
